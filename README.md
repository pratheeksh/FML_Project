## Brief summary 

Music Information Retrieval is an exciting field of research with various machine learning opportunities. Instrument recognition has several applications. It can also help us understand the source of music better and hence, a better understanding of this music information can help improve audio streaming and recognizing platforms. We use ConvNets to learn music instruments from polyphonic music.
